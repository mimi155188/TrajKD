[![ICPR 2026](https://img.shields.io/badge/ICPR-2026-blue.svg)](http://icpr2026.org/) **Official PyTorch Implementation** for the paper "TrajKD: Distilling Knowledge via Adaptive Trajectory Curriculum and Dynamic Weighting".

> **Abstract:** Existing Knowledge Distillation (KD) paradigms typically rely on fully converged teachers... (这里粘贴你的完整摘要) ... Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet demonstrate that TrajKD achieves highly competitive performance against representative methods.

## 🚀 Status: Coming Soon

**The full source code and pre-trained models will be released in this repository upon the acceptance of the paper.** We are currently organizing the code and documentation to ensure reproducibility.
